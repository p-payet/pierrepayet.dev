Let's start a second web challenge on HTB, this one is called Emdee five for life.
It's only worth 20 points too, so it should be an easy one...

The only description we have before starting the challenge instance is:

> Can you encrypt fast enough?

After starting the challenge instance, we land on this webpage:

![webpage](/blog/hackthebox-web-emdee-five-for-life/webpage-1.png)

The webpage provide us a string, and the purpose is to send the MD5 hash of this string.

Easy, let's go to this website to encrypt the string: [https://md5decrypt.net/](https://md5decrypt.net/)

Ok, we now know that the MD5 hash of **mKLopMuyMYtWvvflbpNi is 8eb5f6b4e268fcb945adae6e5b07947e**,
so let's validate the challenge!

Aoutch! It was too easy to be real, the webpage tell us that we were too slow and give us a new string to encrypt.

Let's see what happen when we click on **Submit** button with **BurpSuite**:

![BurpSuite](/blog/hackthebox-web-emdee-five-for-life/burp-1.png)

A POST request with data "hash=ourhash" is sent, and we can see that the POST request contain a
Cookie header **PHPSESSID=tgr5iis70c01731l6h9o1masr7**.

Now that we have these information we can create a python script that will send the POST request with the MD5 hash of
the string and without forgetting the cookie.

```python
import requests, hashlib
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

url = "http://docker.hackthebox.eu:30966"

s = requests.session()
response = s.get(url)

soup = BeautifulSoup(response.content, "lxml")

str = soup.h3.string
hash = hashlib.md5(str.encode()).hexdigest()

myobj = {'hash': hash}

flag = s.post(url, data = myobj)

print(flag.text)
```

I use **requests.session()** to use the cookie in the POST request, I also use the python library **BeautifulSoup**
which allows to get the html of the webpage. Then I use **hashlib** which allows to encrypt the string into MD5.
And finaly I send the POST request and print the server response who contain the flag.

Don't forget to add execution right to the python script:

```shell
chmod +x md5_chall.py
```

And let's execute it:

```shell
python md5_chall.py
```

BINGO! The flag is in the html response!
