Ready for a new challenge? Let's rock the one named Grammar, this time it's a 70 points challenge.

As the description says:

![access forbidden](/blog/hackthebox-web-grammar/access.png)

So this Forbidden page is definitely not a surprise. Let's see if we can find some directories with **DirBuster**:

![dirbuster](/blog/hackthebox-web-grammar/dirbuster.png)

Sadly we can't find nothing with DirBuster, so let's move and try someting else.
Let's see what is the server response by using curl on the **index.php**:

```shell
curl docker.hackthebox.eu:32410/index.php -v
```

![terminal curl command result](/blog/hackthebox-web-grammar/curl.png)

Nothing to declare here either, it's a classic forbidden response from a HTTP GET request...
but what if we try to do some **Verb Tampering**?
It's an attack that exploit vulnerabilities in HTTP methods.
Many authentication mechanisms only limit access to the most common HTTP methods,
thus allowing unauthorized access to restricted resources by other HTTP methods.
If you want to learn more about this attack you can go [here](https://www.imperva.com/learn/application-security/http-verb-tampering/).

After trying different methods, the OPTIONS method seems to be exploitable:

```shell
curl -X OPTIONS docker.hackthebox.eu:32410/index.php -v
```

![terminal curl command result](/blog/hackthebox-web-grammar/curl-2.png)

We can see that the server responded by sending us a cookie, and the response contains as well a POST HTTP form with the comment:

> HTB hint: really not important... totally solvable without using it!
> Just there to fill things and to save you from some trouble you might get into :)

Ok, so let's trust this hint and do not dwell on this form. We will rather focus on the cookie the server kindly sent us.
It seems to be incoded in Base64, we can decoding it by using this [site](https://www.base64decode.org/).

On first try it's not working, and the reason is that there is some junk data at the end of the encoded cookie,
so after removing the **%3D%3D**, who have nothing to do here, the result is some json format data:

```json
{
  "User": "whocares",
  "Admin": "False",
  "MAC": "ff6d0a568d61e5a03bcdb04509d5885d"
}
```

First reflex, let's try to send a request with the **Admin** cookie field set to **True**:

![terminal curl command result](/blog/hackthebox-web-grammar/huh.png)

> What are you trying to do huh?

It seems that modifying the Admin field is not enough to get access. So let's look at the **MAC** cookie field.

The page we want to access is index.php, and we assume that there should be a PHP code that verify if we have
the correct MAC value for letting us get the access. So we can possibly exploit a **Type Juggling**.
There is a weird behavior in PHP comparison mechanism... If PHP decides that both operands look like numbers,
even if they are actually strings, it will convert them both and perform a numeric comparison.
You can read this [document](https://www.owasp.org/images/6/6b/PHPMagicTricks-TypeJuggling.pdf)
if you want to learn more about Type Juggling.

So by changing the MAC field to the value **0** we can trigger a PHP Type Juggling and thus bypassing the cookie verification.

```json
{ "User": "whocares", "Admin": "True", "MAC": 0 }
```

Let's try:

![terminal flag result](/blog/hackthebox-web-grammar/bingo.png)

BINGO! The flag appear in the html response between the \<h1\> tag!
